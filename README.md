# Personal Diary
This python project is about having a personal diary for everyone. 

# What is Personal Diary?
Many of us store our memories in Diary. We spend a little time daily to write diary. These memories bring back our happiness whenever we go through it and are going to stay with us till the end of life.

# Why Personal Diary?
But what if you run out of diaries?
How many of you know that to make 17 page we need to cut down 1 tree.
We are facing many problems because of deforestation. 
Don't you think it is very important to save trees.
Ofcourse it is your responsiblity to protect trees and nature which in turn protect us.
Otherwise we will face consequences like hurricanes, tsunami , earthquates and deadly viruses (Corona virus).
Many natural calamities are due to deforestation.

# Solution
So I came up with a solution to this question. 
If we can replace paper with softcopies like text files, then we are real heros who are saving the world.
So as a responsible person, I created this GUI based python file PersonalDiary for everyone. 

The login.py is the main python file to be executed using any compile to run the file. Along with the file you need to download Sqlite3 Database from 
# https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/ .
All your data will be stored in this Database. 
Do download this software before you run the python file.

Just run the python file to create your memories.
Latest updates of the software will be updated in the GITHUB Personal Diary repository.

I wish you will enjoy my software.
Thanking you :)
